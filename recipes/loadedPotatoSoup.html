<h2>Desciption</h2>
    <p>Thick, creamy potato soup with cheese, bacon, and sour cream. All the fixings. The way momma always made it but slow cooker style!</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and chopped</li>
        <li>1 (32 ounce) carton low-sodium chicken stock</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package thick cut bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¼ cup sour cream</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped scallions, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine potatoes, chicken stock, onion, salt, and pepper in a slow cooker. Cook on High until potatoes are tender, about 4 hours.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon on paper towels and wipe out most of the grease from the skillet.</li>
        <li>Puree potatoes in the slow cooker with an immersion blender until smooth. Add 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese and 1/2 of the cooked bacon, set temperature to Low, and cook for 1 to 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in the skillet over medium-low heat. Whisk in flour and stir until the mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add heavy cream and sour cream and whisk until thickened. Pour into the slow cooker and cook on Low for 1 more hour.</li>
        <li>Ladle into bowls and garnish with remaining bacon, remaining Cheddar, sour cream, and scallions.</li>
